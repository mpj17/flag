This is a simple tool to figure out if a flag is any good. While
designed in response to the New Zealand flag referendum, it is
quite general. The idea is to create a web-page that show a flag
in four different scenarios:

#. 3.75cm by 2.5cm and in colour, which emulates what the flag
   will look like on top of a flagpole

#. The same height as the text of the web-page.

#. 3.75cm by 2.5cm in grey scale, which emulates the flag being
   printed.

#. 3.75cm by 2.5cm in black and white, which emulates the flag
   being embossed.

The page itself is static: all fanciness is provided by JavaScript.
